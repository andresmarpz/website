Go and start that thing. We are often trapped within our thoughts and think, plan or speculate too much before committing.<br/><br/>

For instance, before starting this blog, I’ve had a few failed attempts where I just lost motivation because I wanted to make it perfectly polished.<br/><br/>

That will not happen. Just start somewhere and iterate.
